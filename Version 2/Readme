The objective of this project is to detect cyberbullying on social media
It uses NLTK Library's machine learning algorithms
All in all 8 algorithms have been used to get the maximum accuracy of 70-85%


Use the code in the following sequence:
1. dashSentiment.py
2. TestClassifierModel.py
3. TestClassifierModelTester.py

The first File will use the Dataset provided in the data set folder and create pickles in "pickled_algos" folder.
It will create pickles for following things:
1. Documents
2. Word Features
3. FeatureSets
4. All the Classifiers

Next Use the 2nd file to use the code from pickle
The 3rd file is used to test the Model which returns sentiment.
